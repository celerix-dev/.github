# celerix-dev

High-performance, privacy-first software for developers.

---

## Mission
To build a suite of essential developer tools that prioritize local execution, raw performance, and absolute user privacy. Professional utilities should not require cloud synchronization, data telemetry, or unnecessary resource overhead.

## Core Principles
* **Privacy by Default:** Zero tracking. Zero telemetry. Your data remains strictly local.
* **Performance Engineering:** Leveraging Rust and low-level optimization for a minimal resource footprint.
* **Open Sovereignty:** Fully open-source, auditable codebases that empower developers to own their workflow.
