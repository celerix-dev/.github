High-performance, privacy-first software for everyone.

---

## Mission
To build open-source applications that prioritize local execution, raw performance, and absolute user privacy. We believe that quality software should not require cloud synchronization, data telemetry, or unnecessary resource overhead.

## Core Principles
* **Privacy by Default:** Zero tracking. Zero telemetry. Your data remains strictly local and under your control.
* **Performance Engineering:** Leveraging modern optimization techniques to ensure a minimal resource footprint and near-instant responsiveness.
* **Open Sovereignty:** Fully open-source, auditable codebases that empower users to own their digital tools and workflows.
