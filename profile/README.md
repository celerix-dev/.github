# Celerix: A Federated Local Ecosystem 🛰️

**High-performance, privacy-first software for managed local networks.** *Simple to run. Impossible to track.*

---

## 🛡️ The Celerix Transparency Guarantee
**Your data is none of our business.** Celerix is a suite of tools built for people who want the convenience of modern software without the "privacy tax" of the cloud. 

* **Zero Tracking:** No cookies, no analytics, no "anonymous" IDs.
* **No Telemetry:** Our binaries do not "phone home." There is no background chatter to our servers.
* **Open & Auditable:** The code is public. If a Celerix tool makes a network call, it's because *you* told it to.
* **Total Sovereignty:** You own the hardware, you own the binary, and you own the data.

## 🏛️ The Architecture
Celerix is a collection of standalone tools designed to work together as a federated, local-first ecosystem.

* **Modular & Standalone:** Every application is a fully functional, independent unit. You don't need the whole suite to use one tool. If you only need a file server, just run **Depot**. 
* **Integrated Personas:** Every app includes built-in local identity management, but can seamlessly upgrade to **Celerix Persona** for unified identity across your network.
* **Always Offline:** Every feature in the Celerix suite is designed to function without an internet connection. If the world goes offline, your tools stay up.
* **Local-First:** Apps run on your hardware and save to your disks.
* **Persona System:** Identity handled locally. We recognize your machines so you don't have to manage accounts.
* **Lightweight Allure:** Built for speed and minimal footprints. We prioritize small binaries and near-zero idle resource usage.
* **Hardened Borders:** Designed for private networks. Internet access is an option, not a default.

### 📡 Network Policy
**Local by default. Local by design.** Celerix applications operate strictly within the boundaries of your private/local network. Even when using **Celerix Sync**, data movement is peer-to-peer between your own machines. 

No Celerix binary will ever attempt to reach the public internet. If you monitor your outbound traffic and see a request to an external domain from one of our tools, **report it immediately as a critical privacy bug.**

> **Presto!** Simple tools for people who like to stay in control.
